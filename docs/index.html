			<h1>Jordan Janakievski</h1>
			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>
				I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the
				University of Toronto. My current interest is focusing in artificial
				intelligence and machine learning. I am supplementing my computer
				science degree with my interest in economics and project management.
			</p>
			<p>
				While having only graduated high school in 2021, I have been able to
				build skills in both Python and Java. This has been achieved through
				classes and personal projects. Taking on these opportunities has helped
				me learn about the responsibility of time management and
				self-motivation. As a research project, I developed a mobile app,
				<a href="projects.html" style="text-decoration: none">Plankton Eye</a>,
				that uses machine learning to identify the shape of phytoplankton; I
				earned regional and international accolades for it.
			</p>
			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>Bellarmine Preparatory School <br />2017-2021</p>
			<p>University of Toronto <br />2021-2025</p>
			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<p>
				FIRST Robotics Team 360 <br />General Manager<br />Aug 2020 - June 2021
			</p>
			<p>
				As General Manager , I led alongside our industry mentors, providing an
				invaluable experience for team success and personal growth. The team
				allowed me to explore my potential and understand that boundaries are
				sometimes self-imposed. I quickly learned that robotics was more than
				just the robot. On one level, it encouraged collaboration with different
				people. While on another, it gave me an opportunity to work with both my
				hands and mind. The idea of “learning by doing” immediately connected
				with me. I enjoyed pursuing solutions to our daily challenges with the
				team by my side.
