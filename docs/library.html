				A love for reading, inspired by my mother, opened my mind to some of the
				worldâ€™s greatest thinkers, broadened my perspectives, and developed
				myself as a person. From these experiences, I continued challenged
				myself to grow as a writer and communicator. In high school, I
				discovered the value of non-fiction books, opening the opportunities to
				learn about subjects that I would never be exposed to in school. They
				give me an opportunity to learn from the experts in the fields.

					<h2>Start With Why</h2>
					<h3>Simon Sinek</h3>
					<p>
						Being a leader is not easy. Public speaking, positivity, and
						enthusiasm have never been my strong suit. But finding a message and
						finding a purpose for doing what I do is easy. I always know what I
						am doing and why I do it. Sinek tried to have us focus on our
						message and practice implementing it into our lives. We want to live
						our best lives possible. I found that if people resonate with my
						message, the struggles I face become easier because those people
						will help me improve myself. A "why" is not something that is done
						alone, but requires collaboration and support from others.

					<h2>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff...and It's All Small Stuff</h2>
					<h3>Richard Carlson</h3>
					<p>
						Learning to focus on the important aspects of my life was very
						beneficial. All I knew was to have a completely packed schedule and
						to never stop working hard. This book was able to help reflect on
						certain parts of my day to day that meant more than otehrs. I
						learned that there was a lot of energy wasted on tiny, minisule
						events that served no purpose on making myself a better person,
						leader, and friend. The moment I started to let little problems not
						bother me was the moment I freed myself from the routineness of
						student life.
