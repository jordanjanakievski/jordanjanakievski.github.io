This is a Next.js project.

Once the node modules have been installed, you can run the project.

```bash
# to run the development version of the project
npm run dev

# to build the production version of the project

Once you have a build that you like, you can deploy the project to Github Pages.

```bash

This will trigger a Github Action that will build the project and deploy it to Github Pages.
