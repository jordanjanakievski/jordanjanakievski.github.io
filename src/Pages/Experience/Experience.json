		"description": "Blueprint is a club whose mission is to provide software for non-profits. Initially attracted by its mission, it has offered much more. Having joined in the second iteration of the club, I am helping build and develop the internal infrastructure of the organization. Being part of this team has helped me learn how to work with a .git workflow and build skills in Javascript and React. The chance to work on real projects is not only beneficial for my kinesthetic learning but provides an opportunity to continue to grow my collaborative skills."

		"position": "General Manager",
		"time": "August 2020 - June 2021",
		"description": "As General Manager, I led alongside industry mentors, providing an invaluable experience for team success and personal growth. The team allowed me to explore my potential and understand that boundaries are sometimes self-imposed. I quickly learned that robotics was more than just the robot. On one level, it encouraged collaboration with different people. While on another, it gave me an opportunity to work with both my hands and mind. The idea of “learning by doing” immediately connected with me. I enjoyed pursuing solutions to our daily challenges with the team by my side."
