		"description": "Blueprint is a club whose mission is to provide software for non-profits. Initially attracted by its mission, it has offered much more. Having joined in the second iteration of the club, I am helping build and develop the internal infrastructure of the organization. Being part of this team has helped me learn how to work with a .git workflow and build skills in Javascript and React. The chance to work on real projects is not only beneficial for my kinesthetic learning but provides an opportunity to continue to grow my collaborative skills."

	"First Robotics Team 360": {
		"position": "General Manager",
		"time": "August 2020 - June 2021",
		"description": "As General Manager, I led alongside industry mentors, providing an invaluable experience for team success and personal growth. The team allowed me to explore my potential and understand that boundaries are sometimes self-imposed. I quickly learned that robotics was more than just the robot. On one level, it encouraged collaboration with different people. While on another, it gave me an opportunity to work with both my hands and mind. The idea of “learning by doing” immediately connected with me. I enjoyed pursuing solutions to our daily challenges with the team by my side."

		"description": "BELLARMUN is a middle school Model United Nations conference hosted by Bellarmine Preparatory School. As the Director-General, I ran an external team tasked with organizing the conference. This involved running interviews for applicants, leading and teaching the team members, and executing the conference. This provided invaluable experience for working and collaborating, creatively and effectively with like-minded individuals."

	"U.S. Soccer Federation": {
		"position": "Youth Referee",
		"time": "July 2016 - Present",
		"description": "While a referee’s main focus is to uphold the laws of the game, their responsibility is to keep the players safe. Both are achieved through clear communication between the referee crew, coaches, and players. Even though I began as a shy 13-year-old, I reached out to experienced referees, worked with them, and used their feedback to improve my skills. This developed my confidence moving forward. I built strong communication skills, that allowed me to deescalate high tension and emotional situations. Giving back to a community is very important to me, so I do my best to offer first-year referees that I encounter advice that has served me well during my games."
