				The ability to learn on my own has helped expose me to topics outside of
				my formal education. It has opened my mind to some of the world's
				greatest thinkers, broadened my perspectives, and helped me develop as a
				person. These experiences aid in my continuous pursuit to grow as a
				writer and in my communcation skills. Some of my main areas of interest
				include leadership, business, and personal development.
